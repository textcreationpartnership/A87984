            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N my la≈øt, being of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. current, I gave you ≈øomething an ob≈øcure Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our and the Enemies Actions: But now having the advantage of time and conveyance, I ≈øhall give you the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of a bad memory in a little perfecter forme.</p>
            <p>Upon the fourth current, Newes came to us that the Revolters had gotten all their Winter Provi≈øions, their men, and abundance of Gentry, on board each Ship, and had appointed ≈øeverall Frigots, from <hi>Oa≈øtend</hi> and other places, a day of the Moneth to come to the Harbours mouth, intending upon ≈øight of them to ≈øet ≈øaile, being in hope of the States Men of War their Convoy out to Sea.</p>
            <p>Upon this Information, a man was pre≈øently ≈øent to <hi>Oa≈øtend,</hi> who told us, that there were Iri≈øh-men victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aling there. Upon this, the Lord Admirall advi≈øed with his Councell what was expedient to be done: they ordered every Ship with which of the Revolters they ≈øhould fight at Sea, expecting their comming every houre, which was de≈øired by us; and yet this newes did ≈øomewhat ≈øtartle ≈øome. But when we ≈øuppo≈øed them in their highe≈øt condition, then was there the mo≈øt di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116933:3"/>by rea≈øon of Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> being made Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall (as ≈øuddenly was apparent;) for the next day, being the fifth, (a fatall day for Traitors) the <hi>Constant Warwick,</hi> a Frigot of 32 Guns came from them, which they intended ≈øhould have maintained the re≈øt, having new rigged and tallowed her. This Ve≈ø≈øell we only fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red would e≈øcape and injure the Kingdome, becau≈øe ≈øhe ≈øailes be≈øt of any in <hi>England;</hi> But God prevented their intentions in this, and ≈øince that day they have not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpered.</p>
            <p>The Lord Admirall having intimation from this, and other Ve≈ø≈øels, that more intended to de≈øert them, if there might be an advantage of their ≈øecure comming from them, His Lord≈øhip advi≈øed with his Councell what ought to be done in order thereunto, who concluded it might be advantagious to go up with his whole Fleet, and Anchor board and board with them.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, upon the eighth current, in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, our fore≈øaile was loo≈øed, and guns fired for warning to the Fleet to weigh Anchor (although his Lord≈øhip had made many ≈øcruples, and ≈øeemed to oppo≈øe it) but having lien long in one place, our Cable being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with ≈øand, 'twas ≈øomewhat late ere we could get our Anchors up, and the winde being al≈øo at <hi>North ea≈øt,</hi> ≈øo that we could not get up to them that night, but came to an anchor ≈øhort, mo≈øt of our ≈ømaller ≈øhips anchoring very neer them, ≈øo that they di≈øcour≈øed with them all that night, in which night they put their land ≈øouldiers on board; But the <hi>Hind</hi> a Ship of eighteen Guns, cut her Cables and came to his Lord≈øhip, receiving a ≈øhot through her Hull, but hurt none; The next morning being the ninth, I ob≈øerved their fore-≈øailes loo≈øe,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116933:3"/>and Anchors apeeke, ready to weigh, when they ≈øaw us weigh (halfe the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet were now gone) and as we heard, would fire upon us. When we came up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the flood againe, in the afternoone, we weighed, they weighed, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> weighed, all plying up the river. Our Frigots were round their Admirall, endeavouring to provoke him to fire (as Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> vapoured he would) but they then would not take notice of affronts. There was ≈øo little winde that we could not make our Ships worke, for our Reer-Admirall runne a ground, and one of theirs.</p>
            <p>In ≈øtead of firing upon us, they all ha≈øtened to gaine the Sluice, which we might have prevented had there not been ≈ølackne≈ø≈øe in ≈øome‚ÄîWe had one Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in their Admiralls way, and lay before the Sluice mouth, where our Vice-Admirall might have been al≈øo, if ordered, and then the Valiant Prince could not have runne his head into that hole, as pre≈øently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he did, by carrying a Haw≈øer on ≈øhore, and the <hi>Guinea</hi> Frigot al≈øo, the re≈øt being all at an Anchor as neere the Peere as they could get, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> as neer to them as they could get, and our Fleet mixed with them both, all the three Fleets being within a ≈ømall compa≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>In the night they cut the Cables of five more (which we have ≈øince taken up) and haled them all but one (ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry valiantly) into the Sluice, where one lay thwart the others ≈øterns.</p>
            <p>Our men were mightily vexed to ≈øee ≈øuch brave Ships of their Kingdomes, haled into ≈øuch a place to be ≈øpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and might not have the liberty to fire upon them. All the meanes in the world were u≈øed to provoke them
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116933:4"/>to fire but one Gun, but we could not prevaile to make them breake the peace that the <hi>Hollander</hi> lay to keep.</p>
            <p>The next Morning being the 10. a≈ø≈øoone as it was light, I thought I ≈øhould have ≈øeene ≈øome ≈øcuffle, for the <hi>Love</hi> (a Ship of 38 Guns) weighed and ran right for the Sluice: One of our Ships layd her cro≈ø≈øe the Hau≈øer, forcing her to an Anchor, ≈øome of the Souldiers on board her cryed fire, but immediately ≈øhe yeelded. After her, a <hi>Prize</hi> they had weighed and ≈øtood for the Sluice, we laid her cro≈ø≈øe the Haw≈øer and tooke her. There was a third run her ≈øelfe on ≈øhore, to whom we ≈øent three Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, and divers Boats full of men, who yeelded upon condition that the Captaine and his whole Company ≈øhould go on ≈øhoare with Bag and baggage: But in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim they ≈øend Boats laden with men to relieve her, and our men cha≈øed them all to the Peere, and there Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> was bu≈øie in building Forts, him≈øelf &amp; his men flinging the Turffes, and Stones, and Musket bullets at our men, but dur≈øt not fire ≈øo much as a Pi≈øtol. This Ship is called the <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> a Navy-≈øhip of 28 Guns, now a float again, and our Reare-Admirall al≈øo, who hath taken no harme, a thing much admired. We have taken in all, the <hi>Con≈øtant Warwick,</hi> a Frigot of 32 Guns; The <hi>Hinde,</hi> a Frigot of 18 Guns; The <hi>Love,</hi> a Ship of 38 Guns; The <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> a Ship of 28 Guns; A Ship laden with Sugar, and a Catch. Since this they have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed two Forts, and planted Guns in them, (our Fleet ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding within command of them, ≈øome within Pi≈øtol ≈øhot) have built a Court-of-Guard hou≈øe. If the Towne were their owne they could not keepe a more ≈øtrict guard. They take all men pri≈øoners that come upon the I≈øland, take our Letters, and all things that come over Land to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116933:4"/>us. The Lord Admirall hath ≈øent to the States to know if they will allow a Foreigne Prince to rai≈øe workes to debarre the Engli≈øh Fleet in their Harbour, but no an≈øwer is yet returned.</p>
            <p>They have now taken the ≈øailes from mo≈øt of their yards, are taking out the Guns, and have haled in the fifth Ship that lay cro≈ø≈øe. The≈øe Ships have neer two hundred Bra≈ø≈øe Guns in them, which we apprehend they will ≈øell, for 'tis thought ≈øome of the≈øe Ships backs are broke.</p>
            <p>They have one Ship of fifty two Guns, and three of forty Guns apeece, the <hi>Guinea</hi> Frigot, which carries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirtie, The <hi>Blackmoore Lady,</hi> twenty eight, The <hi>Roe-buck,</hi> twelve Guns, one ≈ømall <hi>Pincke,</hi> two Hoyes, and two Catches, and all hailed into the Sluice.</p>
            <p>The Lord Admirall is now ≈øending Frigots to Sea, towards the <hi>We≈øt,</hi> and <hi>North-coast,</hi> to ferrit the <hi>Iri≈øh,</hi> and every day expecteth the Parliaments Agent from the <hi>Hague</hi> to give an accompt of his Me≈ø≈øage from the States, and then I ≈øuppo≈øe he will have ≈øome thoughts homewards, if liberty may not be gotten to u≈øe our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to reduce the Ships.</p>
            <p>By the carrying on of things between the States and his Lord≈øhip, I apprehend they have ≈øome minde to quarrel, which I ≈øhall be better able to judge of by their an≈øwer when it comes. If we ≈øhould receive but one ≈øhot from the Towne, I ≈øuppo≈øe the Lord Admirall would fire the Ships which would burne downe the Towne.</p>
            <p>We have lo≈øt three good advantages, two whereof were knowne and omitted, which makes men grumble.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116933:5"/>The Prince is well againe, and at the <hi>Hague,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Yorke</hi> is ≈øtill at the <hi>Brill,</hi> who was ill, but e≈øcaped the Pox Ma≈øter <hi>Crofts</hi> gave the Lord Admirall a vi≈øit. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter of the Princes hor≈øe, who came lately from <hi>France,</hi> ≈øayes things looke there with an Engli≈øh face.</p>
